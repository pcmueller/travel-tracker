## Installation

### Clone This Repo

That's right, _clone_ not fork. You will use this repo multiple times, but you can only fork a repository once. So here is what you need to do to clone the repo and still be able to push changes to your repo:

1. Clone down this repo. Since you don't want to name your project "webpack-starter-kit", you can use an optional argument when you run `git clone` (you replace the `[...]` with the terminal command arguments): `git clone [remote-address] [what you want to name the repo]`
1. Remove the default remote: `git remote rm origin` (notice that `git remote -v` not gives you back nothing)
1. Create a new repo on GitHub with the name of `[what you want to name the repo]` to be consistent with naming
1. Copy the address that you would use to clone down this repo - something like `git@github.com:...`
1. Add this remote to your cloned down repo: `git remote add origin [address you copied in the previous step]` - do not include the brackets

### How to View Code in Action

In the terminal, run:

```bash
npm start
```

You will see a bunch of lines output to your terminal. One of those lines will be something like:

```bash
Project is running at http://localhost:8080/
```

Go to `http://localhost:8080/` in your browser to view code running in the browser.
